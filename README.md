# GST_Bill_Generator
Hi! I'm Aniruddha Pandey. I got to make this **GST** bill as a project by my teacher. I have done my best to make it look cool. This program still has some flaws, anyways have a look and don't forget to fork ;)

How you can contribute?
* There is a bug in the program when the user enter item **quantity** < 10. Find it out and pull request!<br/>
* Make a *txt* file to inform other people what is cocept were used to make this program, if you know about it. lol<br/>
* Chcek the function **total_gst** for, I think, replacement of **sum=total-(total*(gst/3)*0.01)** with **total-=total*(gst/3+1);**? I don't know chekc yourself.<br/>
* Try to make beeter algorithm of logic to implement proper calculation.
